## Kaggle M5 Forecasting Competition - Forecasting with LightGBM ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to my Kaggle project for the [M5 Forecasting competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy)! In this exciting challenge, I'm utilizing the powerful LightGBM framework to create accurate and robust forecasts.

#### About the Competition
The M5 Forecasting competition hosted by Kaggle aims to predict future sales for various products in Walmart stores. It involves forecasting sales for thousands of products across multiple stores over time. This competition provides a fantastic opportunity to apply data science techniques to real-world retail forecasting problems.

#### Solution with LightGBM
For this project, I've chosen LightGBM, a popular gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and performance in handling large-scale datasets. Leveraging its strengths, I've developed a robust forecasting model to make accurate predictions.

#### How to Navigate this Repository
In this repository, I've included detailed documentation to help you understand the approach and reproduce the results. Additionally, you'll find the code, data processing steps, and the model training pipeline in the appendix.
